This is an entity.json file generator corresponding to BotPress format.

The idea is to make life easier for non-coders who wish to use BotPress and don't have the patience to write a word for word list in the BotPress interface :)

By generating your own list you can also share it with the other users of BotPress

In summary: Copy your list of words corresponding to your entity in the ENTITIES insert and you get the contents of the json file to upload in the indicated directory. Having obviously filled in other entries
